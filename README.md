This is the girlfriend mod from Tommyinnit (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRigGOh-_ys), made by Vini2003. It doesn't seem to have much other then the overlay in the begining of the mod, as the rest seems to be practally a different mod entirely. So if you know what your doing you can make a fork of it working or make a pull request or something. If anyone has found any files in some of the deleted repositories please upload them here (We are trying to compile them all): https://www.dropbox.com/request/N19bwKETJRDn0nVWx2BO

# Commands
* Press `f` to fire tnt
* Type `/gf` for Girlfriend overlay messages
* Type `/summongf` to summon a villager that can be interacted with the GF overlay (via rightclick)
